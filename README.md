# circuit-breaker-fn

Reusable primitives for implementing the **cicruit-breaker** pattern in Clojure, plus two concrete implementations (`cb-fn`/`cb-agent`).

## Why 

- [great book](https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it) (section 5.2)
- [great article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker)

#### TL;DR
The Circuit-breaker pattern lets you protect against some process that is likely to fail, and provides _wait-for-recovery_ semantics for when that happens (assuming recovery is indeed possible). Anything that goes _out-of-process_ (recoverable remote service/drive) is a good candidate for wrapping with a circuit-breaker. For things that are _in-process_ it may be an overkill, but ultimately, that will depend on the actual use-case.

## Where

## How
### Primitives
Three things are needed in order to implement a circuit-breaker:

- State (managed internally)
- Error handler (how to react to errors)
- Processing handler (the process we're protecting against) 

Looking at the `circuit-breaker-fn.primitives` namespace, we can see there are exactly three Vars:

- `cb-init` (static map)
- `cb-error-handler` (is the right error-handler after partially binding all but the last arg)
- `cb-wrap-handler`  (returns the right processing-handler)

The above are needed for building a complete circuit-breaker component. 

### Components
Using the primitives described in the previous section, we can start building more meaningful constructs.
 
 Obviously, the most general/reusable construct we can apply circuit-breaking semantics to, is the function itself:
 
#### cb-fn [f & cb-opts]
Returns a function that wraps \<f\> with circuit-breaker semantics.

#### cb-opts
- `fail-limit`: How many Exceptions (within <time-window>) before transitioning from _CLOSED_ => _OPEN_. 
- `fail-window`: Time window (in `fail-window-unit`) in which `fail-limit` has an effect.
- `fail-window-unit`: One of `#{:micros :millis :seconds :minutes :hours :days}`.
- `open-timeout`: How long (in `timeout-unit`) to wait before transitioning from _OPEN_ => _HALF-OPEN_.
- `timeout-unit`: Same as `fail-window-unit.
- `success-limit`: How many successful calls before transitioning from _HALF-OPEN_ => _CLOSED_.
- `success-block`: Function (or positive integer) expected to produce an artificial delay (via `Thread/sleep`) after each successful call to `f`. If provided MUST be accounted for in `fail-window`!
- `drop-fn`: Function to handle all requests while in _OPEN_ state (arg-list per <f>). If a default value makes sense in your domain this is your chance to use it.
- `ex-fn`: Function of 3 args to be called last when handling errors. Takes the Exception itself (do NOT rethrow it!), the time it occurred (per `System/nanoTime`) & the current fail count.
- `locking?`: Boolean indicating whether the handler that wraps `f` should run after acquiring a lock (will wait for it). 
- `try-locking?`: Boolean indicating whether the handler that wraps `f` should run after trying to acquire a lock (will NOT run if it fails to acquire one).

#### cb-agent [init & cb-opts]
Returns a vector with two elements:
 - an agent implementing circuit-breaker semantics. Certain limitations apply - see doc-string for details
 - a function to wrap any function destined to be sent to the returned agent
 
#### cb-opts 
Same options as per `cb-fn`, apart from the last two (`locking?`/`try-locking?`), simply because these don't make sense in the context of an agent (which queues actions).

All options are spec-ed and validated (see `validation.clj`). If validation fails, an `ex-info` carrying the result of `s/explain-data` is thrown. 

## Requirements 
As a result of using `clojure.spec` for validation, the minimum Clojure version that will work is `1.9.0`. 

## Alternatives 

- [diehard](https://github.com/sunng87/diehard)
- [circuit-breaker](https://github.com/josephwilk/circuit-breaker)

As far as a comparison goes (between `circuit-breaker-fn` VS the above two), I'm afraid I'm not the right person to provide it, simply because not only I've not used them, but also because I would be terribly biased. I guess I wanted a pure Clojure solution that is highly configurable, and exposes the primitives themselves (as opposed to just the higher-level constructs). Both `diehard` and `Hystrix` (which is deprecated BTW) are Java (or depend on Java libs), and have far greater scope than `circuit-breaker-fn`.`circuit-breaker` is all Clojure, and I did consider it, but it seemed sort of tricky to cleanly extend the impl to agents, and also didn't seem to provide all the knobs I was after. To be clear, that's NOT to say that it's not a good library - I just had a different vision.
