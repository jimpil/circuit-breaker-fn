## Why 

- [great article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker)

- [great book](https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it) (section 5.2)

## Where 

FIXME

## How
### Primitives
Three things are needed in order to implement a circuit-breaker:

- State (managed internally)
- Error handler (how to react on errors)
- Processing handler (the process we're protecting against) 

Looking at the `circuit-breaker-fn.primitives` namespace, we can see there are exactly three Vars:

- `cb-init` (static map)
- `cb-error-handler` (is the right error-handler after partially binding all but the last arg)
- `cb-wrap-handler`  (returns the right processing-handler) 

### Components
Using the primitives described in the previous section, we can start building more meaningful constructs.
 
 Obviously, the most general/reusable construct we can apply circuit-breaking semantics to, is the function itself:
 
#### cb-fn [f cb-opts]
Returns a function that wraps \<f\> with circuit-breaker semantics.

#### cb-agent [init & cb-opts]
Returns an agent implementing circuit-breaker semantics. Certain limitations apply on the returned agent - see doc-string for details.
